# Excel Dashboard Project

## Overview
This repository contains a professionally designed Excel dashboard project that leverages advanced tools such as **DAX**, **VBA**, **Power Pivot**, **Power Query**, and data modeling to create interactive and responsive dashboards. The project includes two main dashboards: a **Sales Dashboard** and a **Construction Management Dashboard**, which users can toggle between seamlessly.

## Features
- **Data Modeling**: Relationships established using Power Pivot for efficient data analysis.
- **DAX Calculations**: Custom measures and calculations to derive key insights.
- **Power Query**: Data transformation and preparation from various sources.
- **VBA**: Automation and interactivity enhancements.
- **Responsive Design**: Dashboards adapt to user inputs with toggle functionality between Sales and Construction views.
- **Visualizations**: Rich charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, line graphs) for data representation.
